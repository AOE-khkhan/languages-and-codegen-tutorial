Dear participant,

It is my great pleasure to welcome you to the tutorial "Domain-specific
languages to high performance: Code generation and transformation in Python"

At the tutorial, we will be learning how to use code generation from the
comfortable and powerful scripting language Python to make writing
high-performance, parallel code for CPUs and GPUs easier, and, perhaps,
even fun.

To make sure you have a good experience and ample opportunity for
experimentation at the tutorial, I would like to ask that you download
and install a virtual machine image that I have prepared specifically
for the tutorial. Follow these instructions to get started:

1. Download a version of VirtualBox suitable for your system and install it:

   https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

2. Download the machine image itself:

   http://andreask.cs.illinois.edu/tmp/dsl-tutorial.ova

3. (Optionally) Check whether the image downloaded correctly using the
   md5sum command line tool (Linux/OS X). On Windows, use this
   tool:

   http://www.pc-tools.net/win32/md5sums/

   Compare the computed checksum with the following value:
   a49989f216970d4b8842eba566a392a6

   Only proceed once the two match. If they don't, delete the file and
   retry the download.

4. Open VirtualBox, click "File > Import Appliance", select the
   downloaded image and just click "Next" a few times.  Once imported,
   double-click on the virtual machine to make sure it starts. After a
   little while, you should see a simple desktop environment.

5. Once all these steps complete successfully, congratulations! You are
   good to go. I'm looking forward to seeing you at the tutorial.

See you soon,
Andreas
